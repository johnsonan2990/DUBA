RR_Run(int timeSlice, List<Machine> machines, State initial, int rounds, Scheduler sched)
Inputs:
  timeSlice- number of steps given to each machine for one context
  machines- the machines to run
  initial- the initial state (= the initial shared state, plus initial stack of each machine)
  rounds- the number of times each machine is given a slice
  scheduler- used to pick the next machine within a round

Output:
  The set of reachable states with the given parameters.

  reached := {initial} //set of reached states;
  currFrontier:= {initial} //The next beginning set to explore from
  for (int s = 0; s < rounds * machines.length(); s++): // Pick a new machine this many times
     machine curr := sched.pick(machines) // Pick a new machine
     for (int dist = 0; dist < timeSlice; dist++): // take this many steps with the current machine.
       RR_step(curr, currFrontier, reached)
  return reached.

---------

RR_step (machine curr, Set currFrontier, Set reached):
inputs: The machine to run, the set to take one step from, the total set of reached (for reference)
Effect: updates currFrontier by adding states either:
          have been reached in the current context and have no successors, or
          one step from a state in currFrontier
Effect: Updates reached with all states seen

Set nextFrontier := {}
for each state s in currFrontier do:
     successors := curr.getSuccessors(s)
     add all in successors to reached // Always add everything seen
     if successors is empty: // no successors
          add s to nextFrontier // Found a dead end state; it needs to stay for the next machine 
     else: // has successors
          add all in successors to nextFrontier // not an dead end state; need to explore its successors but not it.
currFrontier.clear()
currFrontier.addAll(nextFrontier)

Machine
A Machine has a list of rules and one function:
Machine_getSuccessors(State s)
input: a global state
output: a set of states that are successors using this machine
Set ans := {}
for each rule r in this machine do:
  if r is enabled in s
    add s' (result of firing r on s) to ans.
return ans.

A scheduler has one function that picks the next machine to run.
Sample scheduler:
RR_Fair (just cycles through the machine from the first in the list):
int counter := 0
pick(List<machine> machines) -> machine:
  ans := machines[counter]
  counter := (counter + 1) % length(machines)
  return ans;
